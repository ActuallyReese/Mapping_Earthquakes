# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
### The purpose of this exercise was to create a map that displays tectonic plate data, earthquake data, and major earthquake data (magnitude greater than 4.5). The map needed to have three styles as well, and all of these features needed to be toggleable.

## Summary
### While the map is fine as it is, the legend at the bottom right does not update when changing to major earthquake data. It isn't a big issue, but it limits the color options available for the major earthquake data, and could make things confusing. An improvement could be made to have the legend also be attached to the toggles, like the other data.
### The map data also does not loop, so it can be a bit confusing to look at the tectonic plates that get cut off at the edge of the map. I am not sure how to fix this issue at the moment, but I believe it is possible with a little bit more effort.
